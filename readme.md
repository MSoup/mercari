*TODO*

1. ~~Find my listings page~~
2. ~~Use requests to send a get request to that url~~
3. ~~Copy response text into python~~
4. ~~Deserialize response~~
5. ~~Created database of items and associated prices~~
6. Tag sold items
7. Take remaining items and create interface for user (1 - edit single item, 2 - edit multiple items, a - edit all items)
8. Iterate through items (go to each individual item edit page and edit prices accordingly) 
- *read about how to edit fields here*

Thoughts for security:
- Hard code a price floor that an item cannot go below. If user sets a price below the price floor, error and do not update the item. Maybe have the item update to be the price floor price?
- Show user what the updated prices will be and ask for confirmation
- Set delays for each edit to simulate human? Not sure.
