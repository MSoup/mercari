*TODO*

1. Find my listings page 
2. Use requests to send a get request to that url
3. Copy response text into python 
4. Deserialize response
5. Generate list of URLs that represents the edit page of my listings using unique urls
6. Get Price of listings 
- *read about how to edit fields here*

7. Use python to decrease the price by an amount I can designate (input1 is amount, input2 is cooldown period, where the code only updates listings beyond the cool down period ie 24h)
